# What are static variables?

## In short:
Static variables have the property of being initialised once and not being destroyed when the value is returned. For instance, if an int variable is initialised with value 0, itterated once and returned, whenever called again, the function will itterate from the last value given.

## Function call:
static dataType	variableName;
